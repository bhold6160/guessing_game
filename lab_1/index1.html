  <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Brandon Holderman and here's a little about myself</p>
  <h3>Hobbies</h3>

  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <p>Through this class I would like to learn the skills to create a beautifully styled website with simple yet elegant functionality. After successfully completing 201 and 301 course i would like to move onto 401 iOS development to eventually create my own app. I would love to tell you about it but that one is my secret to keep. Maybe one day when it's published in the app store you can try it for yourself!</p>
